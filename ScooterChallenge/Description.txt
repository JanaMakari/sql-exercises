### Challenge Description

As the manager of a scooter shop, you have noticed that many scooters are not original, meaning they are missing a model name. Furthermore, bad scooters typically do not have lights.

Your task involves two steps:

First, Add to all scooter prices in the shop the overall average price.
Then, Calculate the average price for each brand, considering only good and original scooters (i.e., scooters with a model name and lights).
The result should include the brand and the average price - avg_price. Sort the results by the average price in ascending order.
